# Created a Component Folder

I created a component folder for the following reasons:
1. It makes it easier to maintain the code. By organizing the code into folders, it is easier to find the code I am looking for.
2. It also makes the components reusable. By putting the components in a folder, it is easier to find the components I need to reuse in other projects.
